# dlf_plus
Hugbúnaðarverkefni 2 - Android app

Front-End:
https://github.com/Culmenus/dlf_plus

Back-End:
https://github.com/Culmenus/HBV1-spring

Startup:
First run an instance of the Back-End. For data initialization,
follow the Back-End’s README file instructions.

Then make sure to sync gradle files in Android Studio and run on an android emulator.
Minimum API level for the project is 28, and the target API level is 32.

Some users you can try logging in with:
username: user@user.is      password: pword
username: admin@user.is     password: pword2

For the hand-in we changed the endpoint of the backend server to localhost from heroku, since heroku wipes the database regularly.
